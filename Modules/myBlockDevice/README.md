# LKM Block Device Driver

## Description

- Practice with a Linux Kernel Module block device driver to a virtual block device

## Steps

1. Create a virtual block device
2. Create a Linux Kernel Module for that block device
3. Write a program to interact with that device
4. Write a program to verify the results
